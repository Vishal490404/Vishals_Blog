# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello! I'm Vishal. I am a backend-focused engineer passionate about understanding and implementing backend systems.
I have a keen interest in reverse engineering, bug hunting, and cloud technologies. I play CTF's (a lot of them). This blog documents the technical details, architecture, and challenges I faced while building my projects.
