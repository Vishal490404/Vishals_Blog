# HPC Grading Service - National Supercomputing Mission

**Repository:** [AdityaAparadh/nsm](https://github.com/AdityaAparadh/nsm)

This project is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate workshops on High Performance Computing (HPC) technologies like OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA. It provides an integrated environment for learning, practice, and automated assessment.

## Architecture

The system is built around a central Web Application that manages workshops, users, and content, integrated with a JupyterHub environment for hands-on practice and a scalable grading system for automated evaluation.

### Workflow Overview

1.  **Workshop Management**:
    *   Instructors create workshops and manage participants (via CSV or direct enrollment).
    *   Course content (Jupyter Notebooks) and evaluation scripts are uploaded to an **S3 Bucket**.

2.  **User Environment (JupyterHub)**:
    *   Participants log in to **JupyterHub**, which uses **DockerSpawner** to provision isolated containers.
    *   A custom `start` command inside the terminal fetches the specific workshop content from S3, backing up any previous progress.

3.  **Automated Grading**:
    *   Assignments are submitted for evaluation.
    *   The backend pushes grading tasks to a **RabbitMQ** queue.
    *   **Dockerized Evaluation Environments** pick up tasks, run the user's code against the instructor's evaluation script (checking output correctness and execution time), and report results back to the backend.

4.  **Progress & Certification**:
    *   Participants track their progress on the Web App.
    *   Upon completing all requirements, the system automatically generates a downloadable certificate.
