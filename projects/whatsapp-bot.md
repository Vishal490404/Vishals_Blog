Contest-Reminder-WhatsApp-Bot is an automated WhatsApp notification system designed to keep competitive programmers updated about upcoming coding contests from major platforms like CodeChef, Codeforces, LeetCode, and AtCoder.

## Architecture

The bot automates the process of checking for contests and sending notifications directly to user groups.

### How It Works
1. **Scheduled Jobs**: Uses `node-schedule` to run tasks at specific times.
2. **Data Aggregation**: Fetches contest data from Clist API.
3. **WhatsApp Integration**: Uses `Baileys` library to interact with WhatsApp Web API.

## Challenges & Solutions

**The Problem:**
Keeping track of contests across multiple platforms is challenging. Missing contests due to timezone confusion or simply forgetting about them is common.

**The Solution:**
The bot centralizes information by aggregating contest data and provides proactive notifications and smart reminders 30 minutes before each contest.
